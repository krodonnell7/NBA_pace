# NBA_pace

As an avid basketball enthusiast and fan of a notoriously methodical offense in the Villanova Wildcats, I have been enamored with “pace” in basketball and its effect on winning. Pace is how fast or slow a team plays and is defined by the NBA as the “number of possessions per 48 minutes for a team or player.” In this project, I examined pace in the NBA with respect to a variety of variables associated with winning, specifically points per possession and net rating. I utilized box score data from the 2010-11 season through the 2020-21 season, as well as the current season (2022-23).
 
My overarching goal was to determine how pace relates to winning, points scored, and points allowed. Specifically, I wished to determine if it is more advantageous to be a faster or slower team in the current NBA, or if pace is inconsequential.
